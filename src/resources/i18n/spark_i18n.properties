## Additional locales can be specified by creating a new resource file in this
## directory using the following conventions:
##
##   spark_i18n "_" language "_" country ".properties"
##   spark_i18n "_" language ".properties"
##
## e.g.
##    spark_i18n_en.propertis       <- English resources
##    spark_i18n_en_US.properties   <- American US resources
##    spark_i18n_de.properties      <- German resources
##    spark_i18n_ja.properties      <- Japanese resources

## Please note that the two digit language code should be lower case, and the
## two digit country code should be in uppercase. Often, it is not necessary to
## specify the country code.
##
## A full list of language codes can be found at
